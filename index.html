        <p>Hi there! Iâ€™m <strong>Sameera Boga</strong>, a second-year student at <strong>Northeastern University</strong> studying <strong>Business Administration and Computer Science</strong> with a concentration in <strong>Finance</strong>.</p>

        <p>My interests lie at the intersection of finance and technology. Iâ€™ve worked on technical projects using <strong>MySQL and AppSmith</strong> and enjoy building solutions that combine <strong>data analysis</strong> and <strong>application development</strong>.</p>

        <p>Beyond academics, Iâ€™m passionate about <strong>community service</strong> and have worked with <strong>PURE</strong> to coordinate outreach and donation drives.</p>

        <p>Dance has also been a huge part of my life! Iâ€™ve trained in <strong>Kuchipudi for over 12 years</strong> and completed my <strong>Rangapravesam</strong>. Performing and expressing culture through dance is something I deeply cherish.</p>

        <p>Outside of school and work, I love to <strong>sing, dance, and hang out with my friends</strong>. Feel free to explore my website and learn more about my passions!</p>
